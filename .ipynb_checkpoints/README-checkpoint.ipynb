The stock market has responded gingerly to the news, with the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index not dropping immediately. Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, anticipates that if nothing changes, the index might fall by as much as 20% in the following months. In the current environment, investors are rushing to protect their growth-oriented portfolios against danger.\n",

    "Traditional wisdom holds that dividend-paying, stable firms in the value category, together with gold, are the best inflation hedges. However, the economy has altered so dramatically in recent years that the meaning of \"value stock\" has shifted as well. Before purchasing for a crisis, investors should think about pricing power and worldwide market reach.Viewed in this context, some of the top inflation-proof stocks to buy now include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), and MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI), among others modeled within this project"
